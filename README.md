> This is my capstone project for the 9-part IBM Data Science Professional Certificate track curated by Coursera. It centers around analyzing and predicting the severity of vehicular accidents in Seattle, Washington based on information such as time of day, date, road conditions, light conditions, weather conditions, and location. The project uses SVMs to parse and analyze the data, and also covers data cleaning, label-encoding, and feature selection. My full report of the project and findings can be found [here](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data.pdf).
