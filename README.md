# Data_Science_Portfolio

An overview of various Data-Science related projects for my classes at UCLA or for my own enjoyment.

### [[1] Analyzing California Commuter Networks During COVID-19 (Python)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> Shows a brief network creation using _NetworkX_ (which was used for more complex visualizations) and an SIR compartmental model to predict the spread of COVID-19 via commuters in California. My contribution to the group project for the class MATH 168.

### [[2] Predicting Social Support using Machine Learning Techniques (Python)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> A multivariate linear regression model coded from scratch with the results verified using the _function_. My contribution to the group project completed for the class MATH 156.  

### [[3] State of the World - An Overview and On AverageÂ¶ (Python)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> An analysis of data from the United Nations World Happiness Report using beginning Python techniques such as _NumPy_ and _pandas_ as well as some normalized data visualization. Completed as part of a group project for STATS 21. 

### [[4] Surmising Social Support in the United Nations World Happiness Report: A Bayesian Approach (R)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> Folder contains initial data analysis as well as a multi-level model using the _brm_ function to predict social support using Freedom to Make Life Choices and Log Gross Domestic Product data from the United Nations World Happiness Report 2021. Completed for the class STATS C116. 

### [[5] Predicting Car Prices (R)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> A multivariate regression model created using the _lm_ function to predict the price of cars given their model. The model ended up having an accuracy of over 92% on the testing data. Completed for the class STATS 101A. 

### [[6] Cutting Out the Copy (R)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> An overview of how to use the _function_ to import subsections of a data set in an Excel file. Also introduces some brief web-scraping methods. Counted towards credit for STATS 199.  

### [[7] Iron Man's Guide to Discrete Probability Distributions (R)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> A friendly guide to some discrete probability distribution using superhero examples. Includes how to visualize and interpret the results. 

### [[8] Leavin' Lisa (MATLAB)](https://github.com/AMistry001/Data_Science_Portfolio/blob/main/Analyzing%20Seattle%20Accident%20Severity%20Data/Analyzing%20Accident%20Severity%20Data%20in%20Seattle%20(2014-2020).ipynb):
> A compartmental model to evacuate the Louvre Museum in Paris in case of an emergency. My contribution to the group project completed for the class MATH 42.
